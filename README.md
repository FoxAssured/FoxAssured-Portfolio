This project is configured for deployment to GitHub Pages with a custom domain (`foxassured.com`).

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure your `package.json` has the `gh-pages` package installed:

```bash
npm install gh-pages --save-dev
```

And update your `scripts` in `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
}
